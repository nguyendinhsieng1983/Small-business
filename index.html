    <h2>Tourism in Helsinki thrived in summer 2023</h2>
    <p>Helsinki is the most popular destination in Finland, and travel to Helsinki developed positively in the summer of 2023, as well. The number of overnight stays in Helsinki increased by 5% in June–August, compared to summer 2022. The August statistics showed a growth of over 8%. Helsinki’s main advantages as a travel destination are its closeness to nature, marine environment, sustainable values, active culture and unique events.</p>

    <p>Domestic travel to Helsinki increased significantly in 2022 since the pandemic. The number of domestic visitors has also remained at roughly the same good level, which proves that people in Finland want to visit the capital and find new experiences in the city. The number of international visitors increased by over 15% in June–August, compared to 2022.</p>
    <p>“From an international perspective, the capital of Finland is an exotic destination that is not too hot in the summer and where you don’t see the same kind of mass tourism as in Southern Europe. Finland joining NATO also put Finland and Helsinki on the world map, so to speak,” says Nina Vesterinen, Tourism Director of the City of Helsinki.</p>
    
    <h3>Summer visits to Helsinki grew by almost 5%</h3>
    <p>From June to August, Helsinki attracted 1.36 million overnight stays. Of the stays, 52% were by visitors from Finland and 48% by international visitors. The occupancy rate of hospitality businesses was 66%, two per cent higher than the previous summer. Visitors also stayed outside of hospitality businesses, such as in private homes, for example. Their estimated proportion is about 15% of all stays. Helsinki also saw many visitors who stayed for a day, such as people on international cruises. Helsinki Tourist Information assisted over 85,000 visitors from June to August. Of the customers of the tourist information services, 96% considered the information received especially helpful or very helpful.</p>
    <p>Most companies in the Helsinki tourism network also saw the summer as a success.</p>
    <p>Most international visitors came to Helsinki from the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Sweden. Especially surprising growth was seen from Australia. There were also significantly more visitors from Italy compared to the previous year. International tourists seemed unbothered by the rain in Helsinki, compared to the disastrous heatwaves in Southern Europe that caused trouble for visitors there. Due to changing weather conditions, Finland will stand out positively in the future, and the number of international visitors in Helsinki will likely increase. However, this development is not solely positive in terms of sustainable tourism, and Helsinki recognises the issue. This is why Helsinki’s primary goal is to focus on the quality of tourism, not its quantity.</p>

    <h4>Helsinki to develop the visitor experience</h4>
    <p>In July, Helsinki also launched a systematic and goal-oriented way of measuring and managing the visitor experience in the city. The aim is to offer a positive experience to tourists and event visitors coming to Helsinki. The City will see results from the data collected in late autumn.</p>
    <p>“Many visitors appreciate being heard, things going smoothly, and services being functional. The polite and mild-mannered service in Finnish establishments pleases many visitors, compared to a more animated manner that may even feel intrusive,” Tourism Director Vesterinen says.</p>
    <p>Then what would a perfect tourism summer and visitor experience be like?</p>
    <p>“Not too hot, and not too rainy. I hope that visitors would discover Helsinki in a way that would make them want to stay for a long time and visit our various wonderful attractions. Helsinki offers so much to see and experience, and our accommodation capacity is at a very high level. If we focus on sustainability, we can strive towards an increasingly interesting and unique tourism city,” Tourism Director Nina Vesterinen sums up the City’s goals.</p>

    <p>The multi-purpose use of city premises supports the sustainability goals of Helsinki. “Could an overnight stay on the roof of a public building become a new tourist attraction?” Tourism Director Nina Vesterinen ponders.
